This project spans weeks 9 and 10 and concludes all websocket work.

#### Remote repo on Github: `https://github.com/uldahlalex/fs25_kahoot` 

### Agenda, Wednesday 26th of February (week 9)
- 08:15: Presentation: Project reveeal: **The Kahoot Clone** & Relevant theory
    - Presentation link: `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Fjfp4FHT1ZtFiEs_8sQa-VAXPOTbuQE6pqkBbDV2aG8/edit?usp=sharing`

The link to the app I demonstrated Wednesday is here: *(running deployment)* `https://easvkahoot.web.app/`

You can use it by entering the password "ilovewebsockets" and clicking start game + send question (all browsers connected to the app will play along)

You can of course inspect the browser tab to see the DTO structure I use in my solution:

### Agenda, ðŸŽ‚Friday 28th of FebruaryðŸŽ‚ (week 9)
- 08:15: Presentation
    - Deployment of WebSocket APIs
    - Unit testing with real networking
    - NSwag TS generator
    - Various configuration & template handout
- 09:00: One of two of you will help me pick up and carry cake from HÃ¸jvangs bakery next to the school
- 09:15: We eat cake and program awesome kahoot clone

### Starter template link: `https://github.com/uldahlalex/kahoot_template`

##### The template contians the following:
- README.md instructions to add environment variables / secrets
- YML files to deploy client + server app + run tests
- NSwag configuration to generate Typescript types based on your DTOs
- WsClientProvider with appropriate URL based on development/production
- Testing setup with real websocket networking client and usage example
- IConnectionManager implementation
- Entity Framework setup for the Kahoot schema
- Options pattern configuration

So in other words, it does *not* contain all the event handlers / business logic / UI components required to solve the task - **only the boilerplate/configuration that you write once and (mostly) never change.**

### Agenda, week 10
- There will be no presentations any of the days in week 10: Just pure workshop. I will of course be available for assistance.



# The Kahoot Clone Assignment

## Features

The following Kahoot-like features must be implemented:
- When arriving on the "landing page", clients are added to a lobby
- When the admin "starts" a game, all the clients in the lobby are added to the game-room
- Questions are broadcasted by the admin to all clients in the gameroom (beginning of a new "round").
    - Players send ansers to the server during the question phase of the round.
    - After a certain time-delay, the "results" of the round is broadcasted by the server, and the question phase is over.
    - The answers are displayed in the "results" phase.


## Implementation details

- Data should be saved.
    - You must store peristed data in a relational database (like this one `https://aiven.io/free-postgresql-database`).
    - Temporary WebSocket state can be stored in ConcurrentDictionaries


## Tips

- You may build you own "ConnectionManager" from scratch or use a generalized solution I have here: `https://gist.github.com/uldahlalex/a75d4dc99c3cfb99b15a8db4a4af90ba` which can be used for a lot of different business cases including this one.
- You may build your own database schema from scratch or use the one I used in my demo: `https://gist.github.com/uldahlalex/dedc2736839d4f72a5f09aa1c5f6d1d0`
    - The ID's are all text (with no fancy auto-generate, so I recommend you just make GUID's in C# and cast .ToString() before saving)

## Project showcases

When the project is finished, we will have project showcases.
- Each group will host a kahoot quiz live in the classroom - where everyone else will be playing along (yes this means deployment)
- The date for the release party will be Wednesday 12th. Just after the presentations we will begin the next major topic in Fullstack 2025 (same day).

Procedure for Kahoot clone showcases
- Group gives the link to their application
- Everyone joins in and answers the questions
- We have fun

### Questions regarding Kahoot clone showcases:

**Q: Do we have to talk about the project / show code / etc?**

A: No, you don't have to say or show anything (or even stand in front of the class - I can just distribute your application link, so we can play)

**Q: Our clone is not functional / not deployed / etc**

A: No worries - you may also show your UI / present a game round locally if you would like to.
